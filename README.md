# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a secure method for hiding confidential data within digital images using steganography. The technique ensures that the embedded information remains undetectable to unauthorized parties while maintaining the image quality. This approach enhances secure communication and data protection across various applications.

## Features
- Stealthy data embedding within digital images.
- Preservation of image quality.
- Robustness against various attacks and image manipulations.
- User-friendly interface for embedding and extracting data.
- Compatibility with different image formats.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-data-hiding.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd secure-data-hiding
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare your image:**
    - Place the image you want to use in the project directory.
    - Replace the image path in the code (`mypic.jpg`) with your image file name.

2. **Run the script:**
    ```sh
    python steganography.py
    ```

3. **Enter your secret message and passcode:**
    - Follow the prompts to enter the message you want to hide and a passcode for encryption and decryption.

4. **View the encrypted image:**
    - The encrypted image will be saved as `encryptedImage.jpg` and opened automatically.

5. **Decryption:**
    - Enter the correct passcode to decrypt and reveal the hidden message.

## Libraries and Platforms
- **Python:** Programming language used for implementing the project.
- **OpenCV (`cv2`):** Library for image processing tasks.
- **OS:** Library for interacting with the operating system.

## Future Scope
- Developing advanced steganographic algorithms for increased capacity and robustness.
- Implementing real-time applications for secure communication in various sectors.
- Integrating with emerging technologies like blockchain and AI.
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility and user-friendly tools.
